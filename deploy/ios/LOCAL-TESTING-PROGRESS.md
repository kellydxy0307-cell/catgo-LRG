# CatGo iOS — local device testing, progress & resume notes

**Goal:** build the CatGo iPhone/iPad app and run it on *our own* devices for testing
(free Apple ID, no $99 yet). Distribution decision (TestFlight / ad-hoc) deferred.

**Branch:** `feat/mobile-app-456`  ·  **Machine:** this Mac (Apple Silicon)
**Last worked:** 2026-06-02

---

## TL;DR — where we stopped

**✅ 2026-06-04: CatGo built, installed, and LAUNCHED on the iPhone (iPhone 17 Pro Max, iOS 26.4.2).**
The app runs as a live dev session loading its frontend from the Mac over the LAN.

To run it again (device plugged in + unlocked + trusted):

```bash
# from repo root, on branch feat/mobile-app-456:
TAURI_DEV_HOST=192.168.12.236 pnpm tauri ios dev "Jenedith's phone"
#               ^ this Mac's current LAN IP (check: ipconfig getifaddr en0)
```

That builds CatGo and launches it on the connected device. Keep this process running —
the phone loads the UI from `http://<LAN-IP>:3100` and HMR pushes edits live.

### Two gotchas we hit on 2026-06-04 (both now solved)

1. **`tauri ios dev` hung forever on "Waiting for your frontend dev server".**
   Cause: `vite.desktop.config.ts` bound the dev server to `127.0.0.1` only, which the
   phone (a separate device on the LAN) can't reach. **Fix (now committed in the config):**
   the `server.host` now honors `TAURI_DEV_HOST`. You MUST pass `TAURI_DEV_HOST=<Mac LAN IP>`
   when running, or Vite stays on localhost and the phone can't load anything.
   *If the Mac's LAN IP changed, update it (`ipconfig getifaddr en0`).*

2. **First launch failed: "…has not been explicitly trusted by the user" (CoreDeviceError 10002).**
   The app installs fine but iOS quarantines the first launch from an untrusted dev cert.
   The signing cert is **`Apple Development: ijennheart@gmail.com`** (NOT the "Jenedith
   Pascasio Personal Team" in the old notes below — automatic signing picked this identity).
   **Fix (one-time per cert, on the phone):** Settings → General → VPN & Device Management →
   tap the `ijennheart@gmail.com` profile → Trust. Then re-run the command above.

## ✅ Done

| Step | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Checked out `feat/mobile-app-456` | mobile/iOS code lives here (not on `main`) |
| Rust iOS targets | `aarch64-apple-ios`, `aarch64-apple-ios-sim`, `x86_64-apple-ios` |
| `pnpm install` | deps present |
| **Full Xcode 26.5** | installed; license accepted (`sudo xcodebuild -license accept`) |
| `xcodegen` + CocoaPods | installed via Homebrew (Tauri needs both) |
| `pnpm tauri ios init` | generated `src-tauri/gen/apple/catgo.xcodeproj` |
| Info.plist patch | `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false` set in `src-tauri/gen/apple/catgo_iOS/Info.plist` |
| iOS 26.5 platform | downloaded (8.5 GB) — device SDK `iphoneos26.5` + simulator runtime both present |
| Signing | Xcode → automatic signing ON, Team = **Jenedith Pascasio (Personal Team)**, bundle id `com.catgo.app` accepted |

## ⬜ Remaining (start here tomorrow)

1. **Connect the iPhone/iPad** via USB → unlock → **Trust This Computer**.
   - Device must have **Developer Mode ON**: Settings → Privacy & Security → Developer Mode → On → restart.
2. In Xcode signing screen, click **Try Again** — with a device attached, the
   Personal Team generates the provisioning profile and the two red errors
   ("Communication with Apple failed / no devices", "No profiles for com.catgo.app")
   go green. *(Those errors are expected with no device attached — not a real problem.)*
3. Run `pnpm tauri ios dev`.
4. First launch on the device: **Settings → General → VPN & Device Management →
   trust the developer cert** (the "Jenedith Pascasio" developer profile).

## Gotchas / things to remember

- **Free Personal Team limits:** the app **expires after 7 days** (just re-run
  `pnpm tauri ios dev` / rebuild to refresh), max 3 sideloaded apps per Apple ID.
  This is the price of not paying the $99/yr — fine for personal testing.
- **`src-tauri/gen/apple/` is NOT committed** (machine-local, like `gen/android/`).
  After a fresh clone you must re-run `pnpm tauri ios init` **and re-apply the
  Info.plist patch** (`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false`).
- **GitHub does NOT solve iOS distribution.** Unlike the desktop `.dmg`, an iPhone
  refuses to install an unsigned `.ipa` from a download. Real distribution needs
  either ad-hoc (paid, pre-registered device UDIDs) or TestFlight (paid $99/yr).
  See `deploy/ios/README.md`. Apple refs:
  - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing-your-app-to-registered-devices
  - https://developer.apple.com/testflight/
- **Xcode 26 ships no iOS platform by default** — it's an on-demand ~8.5 GB
  download (`xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS`). Already done on this machine.
- If signing shows *"Failed to register bundle identifier"* on another machine/Apple ID,
  change the bundle id to something unique (e.g. `com.<yourname>.catgo`) and mirror
  it in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. (Not needed here — `com.catgo.app` was accepted.)

## Build prerequisites recap (all satisfied on this Mac)

- Xcode 26.5, license accepted · iOS 26.5 SDK + simulator runtime
- Rust iOS targets · xcodegen · CocoaPods 1.16.2 · libimobiledevice (auto-installed)
- Node/pnpm 10.28.2 · Tauri CLI v2.9.6

## Reference docs in repo

- `deploy/ios/README.md` — full iOS build guide (toolchain, signing, Keychain plan)
- `.github/workflows/ios-build.yml` — CI build on a GitHub macOS runner (simulator
  smoke build by default; signed IPA when `APPLE_*` secrets are set)
